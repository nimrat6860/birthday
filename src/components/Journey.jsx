          A boy named <strong>Jaswinder Singh (Jaskaran)</strong> was born on
          29th October 1997 at 1:10 PM in the Airforce Hospital, Kanpur 🏥✨.
          Being the first child of the family 👶❤️ he was the blessing for
          family, Since Mumma and Papa lived alone in Kanpur 🏠, everyone rushed
          to meet the little one 🎉🎊. Hearts were overflowing with happiness
          😄💖, and blessings poured in for the cute little boy 🍼🌟🎈. As I am
          8 years younger than him, I couldn’t see him at birth 👀. I saw him
          for the first time after 8 years ⏳✨, and from that moment, he became
          like a second mother to me 💙👩‍👦.

          He was incredibly special, bringing the joy of motherhood and
          fatherhood to Mumma and Papa 👩‍🍼👨‍🍼💕. From the moment he arrived, he
          became the center of their world, the little spark that brightened
          every corner of their lives ✨🏠. As the son is the best friend of his
          father, he was the cutest little companion for Papa 😄❤️ — always
          curious, playful, and full of energy. My mother’s — and obviously, his
          as well — life completely revolved around him 🌸💖. Her days were
          spent walking behind him, watching him explore, laughing at his
          mischiefs, and playing with him 🏃‍♀️🎈🧸.

          He was very naughty, just like all little kids 😜, always getting into
          small mischiefs and exploring new things 🌟. He found joy in the
          simplest things, turning every day into an adventure 🎈✨. Once there
          was a tubewell in our house, and mumma had strictly prohibited him
          from going near it 💧. But he never listened — he was curious and
          fearless, always sneaking closer to it 👀💦. One day, while playing
          near the tubewell, he fell in 😱💦! Mumma rushed immediately and
          pulled him out safely 🤱❤️. Yet, even after that incident, his
          mischievous spirit remained unbroken 🏃‍♂️💖.

          couldn’t resist and immediately began doing Bhangra steps 💃😆 in
          front of everyone! Because of the strict discipline at the military
          Gurudwara 🚫👶, mothers had to stay in their seats and were not
          allowed to carry their children in front of the soldiers. The soldier
          tried to pick him up and stop him from dancing ✋🪑. But he, being his

          dancing energetically on the kirtan beats 🎵.
